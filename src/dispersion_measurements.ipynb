    "    - Average of the squares of the differences between each value and the arithmetic mean.\n",
    "    - Is useful for have an idea how far from mean they are, considering the weight of each difference.\n",

    "### Standart deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Square root of the variance and expresses the dispersion in the same unit of measurement as the data.\n",
    "    - The most common.\n",
    "    - Dispersion expression in the same unit of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coefficient of variation\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean and is expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "    - Relative variability relationated to the mean.\n",
    "    - Is useful for comparing dispersion between different datasets.\n"
